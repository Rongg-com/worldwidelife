            <p>About Tigers<span>Known worldwide for its distinctive stripes and imposing size, the tiger (Panthera tigrisem) is one of the world’s most iconic wildlife species. While tigers are ubiquitous in culture, sports and entertainment, they are much rarer in the wild and are now close to extinction, with only about 4,500 wild individuals remaining. But tiger habitat remains, giving us hope for a dramatic recovery if we rally behind tigers and protect them from poachers, human-cat conflict and habitat fragmentation.</span></p>
